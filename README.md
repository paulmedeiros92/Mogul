# challenge
This is my Coding Challenge for Mogul.gg
This app is built of the Mogul.gg API and uses my tokens by default on constructor.
It also builds a part of the localstorage data that the normal auth process would create.

This app is a challenge feature where you can challenge top players from each game to a duel. When you challenge a player the app creates a team with both your names in it and then invites the other user to join your challenge.
